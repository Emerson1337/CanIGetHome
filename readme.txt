Hi there,  my name is Emerson and I'm a science computer student at Universidade Estadual do Cear√°. 
Recently I've a new idea to create an automatization process to help peoples out home that would like
to request a uber drive but don't know if they really can paid for this. The idea is to use Uber API, 
specifically  estimate prices to get all uber ride prices from somewhere through a mi band or smart watches
without to get out your phones from your bag for it.
